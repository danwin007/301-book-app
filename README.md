# Project Book App

**Author**: Daniel Nguyen & Brett Packard
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
We are building a mobile app that allows folks to search books via the Google API, save them to a list, manipulate that list, and delete stuff.

## Getting Started
The user should clone down our repo and fire this thing up.

## Architecture
We will be using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, NPM, express, superagent, postgres, ejs, dotenv, and SQL to run this app.

## Change Log
### // 2020.2.5 DAY 1 //
6:30pm: John ran us through the full iteration of how this project should go. We got some pizza and asked some questions.

7:00pm: Brett and I started getting base files set up. 

7:30pmISH: We got some early commits out. 

8:00pm: Ran into some issues with getting the server up. Turns out, I (Daniel) totally misunderstood some basics. Talked to Cory to resolve issue getting dotenv hooked up.

8:40pm: Got page up, basic styling, working on getting other task items integrated. Brett looked up API info.

### // 2020.2.6 DAY 2 //

6:30pm: started working on lab again. This one is mad confusing.

7:30pm: got mixed up on directions. Leo came by and gave us some advice to slow down and do one thing at a time.

8:00pm: built out book constructor, searchHandler, and rendering stuff on show.ejs. Tested and ran into issues. Might have something wrong with data submission.

8:30pm: Got stuck. Talked to John. We had a huge issue with our form submit. Then had lots of issues with our call syntax. He helped us fix and we went on our way.

8:50pm: Talked to John again after getting stuck. He helped us fix our EJS calls. Were were using inconsistent variables when calling and pulling from the API. Looks to be mostly working now.

9:10pm: We worked out most of the issues. We have data populating to the page. Just need to work on CSS and a couple other small features.

### // 2020.2.8 DAY 3 //

2:00pm: Finished lunch, partner power hour, and career work. Now settling into starting on this lab. 

4:30pm: Been working on getting homepage dummy data rendering. Needed help from Cory and Leo to do that. Dummy data is working now. 

### // 2020.2.12 DAY 4? //
 
5:00pm: Got to class early. Going to try and build out Details page before Brett gets in.

6:30pm: Got the details page to load correctly. You can click from homepage to details page for individual books now. Gonna start adding buttons for Update/Delete on details page now.

7:05pm: Buttons live now. Worked on some minor CSS as well. Need to build routes and forms for update/delete before working on functionality.

7:35pm: Got the Delete button working on the Details page. Brett is working on the Update functionality. I'll pivot to helping with that.

9:00pm: I've got the hamburger menu working. Brett got most of the Update functionality working. We are gonna sort out merge conflicts and Brett will finish Update features while I work on CSS the rest of the night.
