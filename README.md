# Project Book App

**Author**: Daniel Nguyen & Brett Packard
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
We are building a mobile app that allows folks to search books via the Google API, save them to a list, manipulate that list, and delete stuff.

## Getting Started
The user should clone down our repo and fire this thing up.

## Architecture
We will be using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, NPM, express, superagent, postgres, ejs, dotenv, and SQL to run this app.
